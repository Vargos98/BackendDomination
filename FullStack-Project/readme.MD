# Jokes App

A simple full-stack web application that displays jokes fetched from an Express backend. The project demonstrates the integration of React for the frontend and Express for the backend, focusing on REST API communication and essential web development concepts.Also, implemented Proxy server as to prevent CORS errors and other security issues.

---

## **Features**
- **Frontend:**
  - Built with **React** and styled using basic CSS.
  - Fetches jokes data from the backend using **Axios**.
  - Dynamically renders the jokes and displays the total number of jokes.

- **Backend:**
  - Built with **Express.js**.
  - Provides a REST API (`/api/jokes`) to serve a list of jokes.
  - Handles HTTP requests and sends JSON responses.

---

## **Technologies Used**
### **Frontend**
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
- **Vite**: As the development server and build tool.

### **Backend**
- **Express.js**: For setting up the server and handling routes.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the backend server.

---

## **Setup and Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. Start the development servers:
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. Access the application:
   - Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## **API Details**
### **Endpoint**: `/api/jokes`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Programming Joke",
      "content": "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!"
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```

---

## **How It Works**
1. The frontend makes an **HTTP GET** request to `/api/jokes` using Axios.
2. The backend processes the request and responds with a list of jokes in JSON format.
3. The frontend dynamically renders the jokes, displaying the title and content for each joke.

---

## **Lessons and Concepts Implemented**
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
  - Using Axios in React to fetch data from an Express backend.
- **React Concepts**:
  - State management using `useState`.
  - Side effects handled with `useEffect`.
  - Dynamic rendering with `map()`.
- **Backend API Design**:
  - Building a REST API in Express to serve JSON data.
- **Vite Proxy Setup**:
  - Configured Vite's `server.proxy` to forward API requests to the backend during development.

---

## **Possible Future Enhancements**
- Add pagination for jokes.
- Implement a form to allow users to submit new jokes.
- Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store jokes instead of hardcoding them in the backend.
- Deploy the app using cloud services (e.g., Heroku for the backend and Netlify for the frontend).
